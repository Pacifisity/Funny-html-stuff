    <h1>Valorant Esports</h1>
    <p>I chose these teams related to players that i've enjoyed watching or have "borrowed" strategies from. I'm a fan of sentinel's TenZ due to his highly aggresive playstyle on characters you wouldn't normally expect it from. I'm also a fan of Tarik, also on sentinels, for his ability to accept mistakes. Although I have such a strong connection with sentinels, NRG and TL have some plays in another game that I like that makes me wish for their success as well.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>(SEN) Sentinels</li>
        <li>(NRG) Energy</li>
        <li>(TL) Team Liquid</li>
    </ol>
