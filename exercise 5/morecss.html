        <p class="bcolor round">The width attribute sets a defined beginning width, and if used alone will make an object's width static. If you use a min-width element it will make the element more flexible in that it will be able to shrink down to a specific size. Vice-versa with max-width, it will grow to a certain size when other elements inside of it need that size but it will not go beyond that size.</p>
        <!-- d -->
        <p class="bcolor shdwbx">A shadow box is just a shadow that takes the shape of the element and places a black outline of the element behind it. This outline is then offset and blurred in many ways to create a shadow for the element, of which the color can be whatever color you want.</p>
        <!-- e -->
        <p class="opwash">The opacity element can specify whether an element is see through or not, allowing you to see other elements hidden behind it. You can modify the opacity element to make it more or less see through.</p>
