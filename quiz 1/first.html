    <h1>My Recommendations</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't just rely on resources in the course, youtube has loads of wonderful tutorials and entertaining explanations</li>
        <li>Try things outside of the exercises, make things that you enjoy making rather than only making a web page when you have a prompt</li>
        <li>Write down due dates for all classes (if you're taking more than one), sometimes things will overlap</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed some of my tips for being successful in CSCI 1145</p>
