        <h2>Writing Through Reading</h2>

          I am a reader learning how to write. In middle school when I got my
          first opportunity to freely choose what to read for my project, I fell
          in love with reading. I didn’t have a huge pool of books that I could
          choose from, and the books all related to the dire times of Nazi
          Germany, but I was satisfied with any freedom I could get. The teacher
          began to explain the due dates for when we were supposed to have read
          everything but at this point, I had tuned her out. I was basically
          focused on reading the first few pages of each book and making the
          most of my time. Eventually, one piqued my curiosity: Prisoner B-3087.
          In a few pages, I was already hooked and by the end of class, I was so
          lost in the book that I forgot about all of the other choices.

          Three hours, that’s how long the pre-college math class was. Three
          hours might not sound like much; your average college student might
          even spend more than that binge watching their favorite show or
          scrolling TikTok. However, in an environment where hearing a pen drop
          would be almost ear-piercing… it wasn’t even comparable. Twice a week,
          I walked into the classroom and sat so close to other students and yet
          felt so far away. I have nearly completed the course and don’t need to
          attend the classes anymore. Not only have I completed it but I've done
          all 3 sections of 1099; I’ve already learned many of these concepts in
          the past. My high school transcripts were an absolute mess and I never
          took the SAT so I was put in the lowest level math classes available.
          Needless to say, I blew through them; despite that, it took five weeks
          for Aleks to place me where I needed to be. The novelty of a new
          school year was already wearing off at this point.

          I expected this to be one of the more difficult projects, not because
          of the normal difficulties such as restrictions and expectations but
          simply because there are no restrictions. Similar to my first
          experience getting an opportunity to read a book of my choice, being
          able to write about anything I wanted was just as unbelievable. Then,
          through this remix I was enlightened on the idea of writing not being
          in just one format. I can take my writing skills and smoothly mesh
          them with my other skills and things that I enjoy. In this case, I
          chose to build a webpage.

          What do you think an advertisement based on clothing should look like?
          There are a ridiculous amount of bad advertisements from these million
          dollar companies. Whether they’re doing it with no regard for good or
          bad publicity or just genuinely think it’s a good way to sell their
          product. These advertisements that come to your doorstep are not
          selling you clothes, they’re eroticizing violence and selling it!
